# Part 1.1 – Getting Started with Python

Welcome! In this section, we will set the foundation for learning Python programming.  
We’ll learn what Python is, how to write our first lines of code, and how to use `print()` for output.

## 🐍 What is Python?

Python is a beginner-friendly, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability.  
It is widely used in web development, data science, automation, AI, and more.


## 🖥️ Writing and Running Python Code

There are many ways to run Python code:

### 🅰 Option 1: Online (Recommended for beginners)
You can write and run Python code directly in the browser without installing anything:

- [PythonTutor](https://pythontutor.com/)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/)
- [Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/)

### 🅱 Option 2: Local setup
You can also install Python on your own computer:

- Download from: [https://python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- Use an editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

To run code locally:
```bash
python filename.py
```

### 📤 The print() Function
The print() function displays text or values on the screen.

✅ **Examples:**
print("Hello, world!")  
print("Python is awesome!")  
print(42)  
print("3 + 4 =", 3 + 4)

🧠 **Notes:**
Text must be inside quotes (" " or ' ').

You can print numbers or results of expressions.

Multiple arguments can be separated by commas.

### 📝 **Practice Task (Try it yourself!)**
Create a Python file called hello.py and write the following:

print("Hello, Python learner!")  
print("This is my first Python file.")  
Save and run the file using your chosen method (online or local).

✅ **What's Next?**
In the next section, we’ll learn about variables and how to store data in them.

Keep practicing and try changing the messages you print!
